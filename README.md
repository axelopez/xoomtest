JAVA DEVELOPER TEST

Build an HTTP web server to serve GET and POST requests for static content on the filesystem.  
Use only libraries from the JDK and your unit testing library of choice (junit, testng, mockito, etc).  
No other third party jars are allowed.  
Pay particular attention to issues of multi threading, caching, memory consumption, and performance.  
Be prepared to defend your implementation and describe your roadmap for improving the software.  
Do not spend more than five hours on this project.
